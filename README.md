**Task 2: Email Marketing Template**
An email marketing template is a pre-designed layout that you can use to create and send promotional emails to your subscribers. The goal is to create a visually appealing, engaging, and effective email that encourages recipients to take action, such as making a purchase or visiting a website.



A good email marketing template should be:

**- Visually Appealing:** Attractive and consistent with your brand's identity.

**- Clear and Concise:** Communicates the message clearly without overwhelming the recipient.

**- Responsive:** Optimized for viewing on different devices, including desktops and mobile phones.

**- Actionable:** Includes a clear call-to-action (CTA) that encourages recipients to take the desired step.
